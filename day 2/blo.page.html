    <h2>Dont trust anyone</h2>
    <p>In today’s world, trust is a fragile currency. We often wear masks, hiding our true selves from others—and sometimes even from ourselves. “Don’t trust anyone” may sound harsh, but it’s a caution rooted in countless betrayals and disappointments. People lie, manipulate, and act in self-interest, even when they seem genuine. Blind trust can lead to heartbreak, financial loss, or deeper emotional scars. This doesn’t mean you must live in isolation—but stay alert. Trust should be earned, not given freely. Keep your circle small, your instincts sharp, and your boundaries firm. It’s not about being cold—it’s about protecting your peace.

<h2>Trust everyone</h2>
<p>What if we chose to see the good in people first? Trusting everyone doesn’t mean being naive—it means believing in the potential for kindness and connection. When we approach others with trust, we often inspire honesty in return. Trust builds bridges where fear builds walls. Yes, some may take advantage—but many more will surprise you with integrity. Living with an open heart invites meaningful relationships and deeper understanding. It’s about choosing hope over suspicion. Trust is the foundation of every community, friendship, and partnership. Start by giving it freely—you might just change someone’s life, including your own.
